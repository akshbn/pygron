# pygron

`pygron` helps you easily grep through JSON.

**Note:** This is a python implementation of [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron).

JSON is converted into a set of multi-line assignment statements so that it becomes easy to display the output of grep.

**Pygron** also supports reading JSON from a file as well as writing output to a file.
